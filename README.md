<h2>Abstract</h2>
In todayâ€™s era of high technology, security is one of the major concerns. Nowadays, security surveillance cameras
are stationed everywhere in order to detect any kind of anomalous object. In most of the cases, CCTV footage is used after
the occurrence of crime, as post evidence. CCTV operators monitor the scene from CCTV but their attentiveness can easily
meander due to long shifts. Effectuality of these cameras can be improved by application of object detection algorithms and
image processing. Through this paper, we are presenting a neural-network based weapon detection system. It utilizes the
concept of deep learning and transfer learning techniques to deliver a highly efficient approach. In our approach we have
applied Transfer Learning with the Inception ResNet network to our own custom dataset, called BVCOE Weapon
Classification, to get a stellar accuracy of approximately 94%. This framework will reduce the waste of labor, time, and data
resources. This proposition can be utilized as an intelligent surveillance system.

<h2>Results</h2>
After fitting our customized model, and training it
with a number of epochs, we made predictions on
different batches of images using our model. After
training our model with at around 35 epochs of 113
batches each, the accuracy of our model reached its
convergence. We got a training accuracy of
approximately 98.56%, validation accuracy of
93.65%, which are exceptionally great results. The
training loss was around 0.6 and the validation loss
was around 0.7837.
